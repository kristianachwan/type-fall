### TYPEFALL Game 


### General Overview: 

This game is developed by Kristian Hadinata Achwan and Joshua James 
Originally inspired by magic touch game, but this version involves the use of keyboard instead of touch-screen. 

### Tech Used: 

The game itself is built mainly by React, MaterialUI, and CSS. The animation involves the use of keyframe. 

### Future improvements: 

We do admit that the project is not bug-free. Therefore, we are happy to receive your feedbacks to improve the game, either technical-feedback or just simply from the aspect of the game instead. I would be happy to extend this project whenever I have opportunity to do so. The best case, is that, we are able to build this into worked game in mobile app (soon?). 

Cheers.
